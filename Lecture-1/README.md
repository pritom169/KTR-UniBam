*Q1. What is Internet?*
- The Internet is an interconnected network of networks.

*Q2. What is protocol?*
- Sending and Receiving information between Router, Switches and Many other end
devices is controlled by protocol. Protocol governs everything that happens in a 
network.
- Protocols define the format, order of messages sent and received among network
entities, and actions taken on message transmission, receipt.

> IETF: **Internet Engineering Task Force** governs the Internet standards using
**Request for Comments**

*Access network:*
- Access network is the host, (the device or the end system) that connects to
the internet.
*How to connect host systems to edge router?*
- Residential access nets
- institutional access nets(school, company)
- mobile access network(Wifi/4G)
*What to look for*
- transmission rate (bits per second) of access network. AKA how fast is the network.
- shared or dedicated access among the users (AKA to what degree the network is shared)

##### Access Networks: cable-based access
In access network, a single cable headed connects multiple homes. The signal from and
to those houses are sent at different frequencies. Different frequencies do not interpret
with each other just like FM radio frequencies.

- *Frequency division multiplexing(FDM):* Different channels multiplied in a different frequency
band.
- *HFC: Hybrid fiber coax:* They are asymmetric, which means they provide data in a downstream
manner rather than upstream. Which means we are consumer of data rather than producer of
data. Typical cable transmission rates are 40MBPS - 1.2GBs downstream transmission rate,
30-100Mbps upstream transmission rate. Usually your modem will limit the upstream and the
downstream limit. Basically, you get what you pay for.
